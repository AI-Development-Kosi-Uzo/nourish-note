Paleo Pineapple fried rice with chicken breast

Since traditional fried rice uses regular rice, which isn't paleo-friendly, we'll make a cauliflower rice version for this paleo pineapple fried rice with chicken breast! Here's what you'll need:

**Ingredients:**

* **For the cauliflower rice:**
    * 1 head of cauliflower, riced (you can use a food processor or box grater)
    * 1 tablespoon avocado oil or coconut oil
    * 1/2 teaspoon salt

* **For the stir-fry:**
    * 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, diced
    * 1 tablespoon avocado oil or coconut oil
    * 2 cloves garlic, minced
    * 1 teaspoon grated ginger
    * 1 cup chopped fresh pineapple
    * 1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper
    * 1/4 cup chopped green onion (separate the white and green parts)
    * 2 large eggs, beaten
    * 3 tablespoons coconut aminos (or soy sauce for a non-paleo option)
    * 1/4 cup chopped cashews (optional)
    * Salt and black pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the cauliflower rice:** In a large skillet or wok, heat the avocado oil over medium heat. Add the riced cauliflower and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5-7 minutes, or until the cauliflower rice is softened slightly. Remove from the pan and set aside.

2. **Cook the chicken:** Heat the remaining avocado oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced chicken and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.

3. **Saut√© the aromatics:** Add the garlic and ginger to the pan and cook for 30 seconds, or until fragrant.

4. **Incorporate vegetables and pineapple:** Add the chopped red bell pepper and white parts of the green onion to the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until softened slightly. Then, add the chopped pineapple and cook for another minute.

5. **Scramble the eggs:** Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and pour in the beaten eggs. Scramble the eggs until cooked through, then stir them together with the vegetables.

6. **Combine everything:** Add the cooked cauliflower rice, chicken, coconut aminos, and cashews (if using) back to the pan. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes, or until everything is heated through.

7. **Season and serve:** Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Garnish with the green parts of the green onion and serve immediately.

**Tips:**

* You can add other paleo-friendly vegetables like chopped broccoli, carrots, or snap peas to the stir-fry.
* If you don't have coconut aminos, you can substitute it with soy sauce for a non-paleo option. Just be mindful of sodium content.
* Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
